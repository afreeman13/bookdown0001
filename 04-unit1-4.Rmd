## Unit 1.4 – Random Sampling and Experiments {-}

**Sampling**

- A preferred method of sampling is a _simple random sample_.  In a simple random sample, every member of the population has the same chance of being selected for inclusion in the sample.
- A _convenience sample_ is a sample in which the researcher uses an easily available or “convenient” group to form a sample. 
- A _voluntary response sample_ is a sample in which participants are self-selected. In other words, each participant chooses to participate. 

Convenience samples and voluntary response samples often yield biased samples.  A biased sample is a sample in which the members of the sample differ from the population in some systematic way, so that some individuals are more likely to be selected than others for inclusion in the sample.

**Experiments**

The goal of an experiment is to determine how changes to an explanatory variable affect a response variable.
_Direct control_ and _random assignment_ are two strategies that allow us to rule out other possible explanations for changes to the response variable.
Random assignment ensures that the treatment groups have similar characteristics.

This helps to control for variables that we may not know about in advance and enables us to draw cause-and-effect conclusions about the effect of the explanatory variable on the response variable. 
Generally, we only draw cause-and-effect conclusions from experiments and not from observational studies.

When conducting a statistical study, we often will use data from a sample to draw conclusions about a population.

_Population_: set of all people or objects that share certain characteristics.
_Sample_:  subset of all people or objects that share certain characteristics.
_Subjects_: individuals or objects in the study
_Variables_: the characteristics of subjects that we study

The two main types of statistical studies are:

**Observational studies**

- Researchers observe characteristics of a sample of subjects in a population. 
- No variables are manipulated. 
- If the sample is representative of the population, we can use the results of an observational study to make generalizations about the population.
- The best way to ensure that a sample is representative is to use a random sample.

**Experiments**

- Researchers examine how one variable (response variable) responds when another variable (explanatory variable) is manipulated.
- In an experiment, researchers assign subjects to treatment groups and control groups.
- Experiments allow us to make cause-and-effect conclusions.
- In an experiment, it is possible to reach cause-and-effect conclusions if the study design uses random assignment to create the experimental groups. 
- If an experiment uses both random assignment to create experimental groups and random selection from some population, it is possible to make cause-and-effect conclusions and to generalize these conclusions to the population.
