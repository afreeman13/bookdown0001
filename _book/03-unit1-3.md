## Unit 1.3 â€“ Research Questions & Types of Statistical Studies {-}

When conducting a statistical study, we often will use data from a sample to draw conclusions about a population.

_Population_: set of all people or objects that share certain characteristics.
_Sample_:  subset of all people or objects that share certain characteristics.
_Subjects_: individuals or objects in the study
_Variables_: the characteristics of subjects that we study

The two main types of statistical studies are:

**Observational studies**
Researchers observe characteristics of a sample of subjects in a population. 
No variables are manipulated. 
If the sample is representative of the population, we can use the results of an observational study to make generalizations about the population.
The best way to ensure that a sample is representative is to use a random sample.

**Experiments**
Researchers examine how one variable (response variable) responds when another variable (explanatory variable) is manipulated.
In an experiment, researchers assign subjects to treatment groups and control groups.
Experiments allow us to make cause-and-effect conclusions.
In an experiment, it is possible to reach cause-and-effect conclusions if the study design uses random assignment to create the experimental groups. 
If an experiment uses both random assignment to create experimental groups and random selection from some population, it is possible to make cause-and-effect conclusions and to generalize these conclusions to the population.
