Unit 1.2 introduced the 4-Step process of a statistical investigation.

4-Steps in a Statistical Investigation

1. Ask a question that can be answered by collecting data.
2. Decide what to measure and then collect the data.
3. Summarize and analyze the data.
4. Draw a conclusion and communicate the results.

## Summary {-}

The Chronotype investigation in Collaboration 1.2 provided an example of this 4-step process.  In this activity, we investigated the question, “Is Chronotype Theory reasonable?”.  We were told that in a sample of 50 students, 26, or 52%, selected the chronotype for themselves that was predicted by Chronotype Theory.  

To assess whether this sample provided evidence that the theory was reasonable, we had to rule out chance variation as the reason for the successful matches.  The theory could be false, but due to chance alone, correct predictions could be made.  

We needed to compare the 52% sample result to the results that would occur based solely on chance.  Due to chance alone, there is a 1/3 chance that a person’s chronotype could be chosen correctly.  Using a simulation, we found that if there is a 1/3 chance of an outcome occurring solely due to chance, it is very unlikely that in 50 trials, the outcome will occur 52% of the time.  In other words, if Chronotype Theory is false, and there is a 1/3 chance of correctly selecting a person’s chronotype, it would be very unlikely that in 50 trials, 52% would be chosen correctly.  Ruling out chance variation as the reason for the successful predictions leads to the inference that Chronotype Theory may be reasonable.
